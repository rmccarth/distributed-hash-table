Distributed Hash Table (DHT)

h ( ip, port)

***********************
*Non-scalable Solution*
***********************

1) create a few peers, take their fake ip and port and hash to assign IDs
2) create a fake file.
3) hash the table and store it in its proper hash tabled based on the hash ( id >= k )
